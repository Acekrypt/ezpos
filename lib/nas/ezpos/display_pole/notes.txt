Logic Controls pole display are controlled by command codes and data
from the computer.  The model of pole display that you have will
determine which command set works with your pole. Refer to the model
identification chart for further information.

Commands are transmitted to the pole display as ASCII codes.  The
command codes listed below are expressed in hexadecimal (base 16)
numbers enclosed inside angle brackets < >, in decimal numbers
enclosed in parenthesis ( ), and in ASCII characters enclosed in curly
brackets { }.  Do not include the brackets as part of the command. 
&#8216; ^ &#8216; character denotes &#8216;Ctrl&#8217; in the
keyboard.  Press and hold &#8216;Ctrl&#8217;, then press the next key.



LOGIC CONTROLS COMMAND SET (PD3000, PD6000, TD3000):


1.	Vertical Scroll Mode  <12>, (18), {^R}:
Data is written into the second row and transferred to the first row
when carriage return is received, leaving the second row empty.

2.	Normal Display Mode  <11>, (17), {^Q}:
Data can be written into either row.  Moves to the left most digit of
the other row when line is full.

3.	Brightness Control  <04>, (04), {^D}:
The brightness of the display can be adjusted using this command
followed by a data byte <FF>, <60>, <40> or <20>.
	<04><FF>	-	100% Brightness
	<04><60>	-	60% Brightness
	<04><40>	-	40% Brightness
	<04><20>	-	20% Brightness

4.	Back Space  <08>, (08), {^H}:
The cursor position moves one digit to the left erasing the previous
information.

5.	Horizontal Tab  <09>, (09), {^I}:
The cursor position shifts one digit to the right without erasing
character at original cursor position.

6.	Line Feed  <0A>, (10), {^J}:
The cursor position moves to the same position in the other row.  In
vertical scroll mode, if cursor was in second row, the cursor will not
move and display will scroll up.

7.	Carriage Return  <0D>, (13), {^M}:
The cursor moves to the left most digit of the row it is in.

8.	Digit Select  <10>, (16), {^P}:
Moves the cursor to any position on the display with this command
followed by a data byte of <00> to <27>, or in decimal (00) to (39).
	e.g.	<10><00>	-	MSD of top row
		<10><13>	-	LSD of top row
		<10><14>	-	MSD of bottom row
		<10><27>	-	LSD of bottom row

Assign a keyboard key (ASCII code <20> to <7F>) to a different style
font. The &#8220;X&#8221; represents the ASCII code for the selected
key. The &#8220;F&#8217;s&#8221; represent the 5 segments that will
make up the special font.  These bytes are translated to binary (1 and
0) to indicate whether a dot is to be turned ON or OFF.  The 5 bytes
form 35 bit stream of 1&#8217;s and 0&#8217;s starting from the
top-left corner of the character, running from left to right (each
data byte is interpreted from LSB to MSB).

e.g.	Character &#8216;8&#8217; is composed of <2E>, <46>, <17>, <A3>,
<03>
			
0	1	1	1	0		2E   (0010  1110)
